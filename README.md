# Bulut: A GameMaker Studio Game

Made in March 2016.

Version: 0.9.9
The main game, more of a minigame. Although simple it was a practice project between Tan Arin and Arthur Bobrek (Ant Art).

Ant Art is the collaboration between Ratking and Sir Curtain. Under Ant Art we make small project games, which are free to download. Since they are small games, new ones will be available about every month.

Although we share the work, Sir Curtain is the main Programmer and Ratking is the game's Artist, any other work is shared between us.

This is our first game and we made it mostly to improve our game development. This game is just a quick top down shooter with a main protagonist in a vague dungeon. Hope you enjoy and would love feedback!

Controls:
Z to fire
Arrow keys to move
Hold space to move slower
